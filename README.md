After opening the app, click on "Get Started." You must enter both a Note Title and Note Text for the note to be saved. Once both have been entered, click the "save" icon on the top right corner. Notes will be saved on the left sidebar. To delete a note, click on the red trashcan that appears on the sidebar next to the note you want to delete.
